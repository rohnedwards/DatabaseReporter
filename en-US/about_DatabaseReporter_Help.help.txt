    DatabaseReporter help system.

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An explanation of how the help system works for functions generated using the 
    DatabaseReporter engine.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    Help for DbReaderCommand instances can be defined in two ways:
      * Comment based help right after the first line before the param() block
        definition
      * With [MagicPsHelp()] attributes before the param() block

    <MORE HELP GOES HERE, BUT SHOULD [MagicPsHelp()] JUST BE REMOVED?>
    
    Below is an example DbReaderCommand instance skeleton demonstrating both
    ways to define help. N

    DbReaderCommand TestCommand {
        <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            This will override the default .SYNOPSIS that is defined inside the DatabaseReporter.ps1 
            file's reference command. Any sections missing here that are defined in the reference
            command will still be present on the final 'TestCommand' that's being defined.
        

        .EXAMPLE
            Defining this example means that all examples from the DatabaseReporter.ps1 file's
            reference command are ignored.

            Synopsis = 'Extra synopsis',
            UpdateMode = 'Merge',
            # This part is kind of important...notice that instead of using 'Example', we use 'Examples' and provide it a scriptblock for array
            Examples = { echo "Other Example 1", "Process id: $pid", "Notice how the previous example has dynamic content"},
            # Same as examples...when doing this, we need 'Parameters' (plural). Perhaps one day can expand this to allow single instances
            Parameters = {
                # This is SUPER clunky b/c I can only include strings or scriptblocks here...
                # Remember that you should be able to just do comment based help for parameters, so this method should be discouraged
